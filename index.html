    <title>Easter Egg Painting at the Hodgkin&quot;s - FAQ</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>What is the day all about?</h2>
            <p>
                This crazy egg-painting tradition started many years ago, when the Hodgkin family painted eggs every year, as part of our 
                celebration of Easter Sunday. We started with boiled eggs but they soon got too pretty to eat, so now we use blown eggs, 
                that get varnished and kept.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays the Hodgkin family is more like a clan or a tribe than anything else and it's a chance for
                family and friends to get together with us to paint eggs, socialise, eat and be merry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Who can come along?</h2>
            <p>
               Generally, all are welcome, but to keep numbers manageable please let the family member (however loosely you define that!)
               that invited you know that you are coming. Your partner and children are welcome as well, but please let us know numbers 
                so that we can cater accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children are welcome to decorate eggs, with a separate table is provided for the younger children. It seems to
                work well if the children have their turn when they first arrive, with their parent's help, and then parents are 
                free to paint their own eggs afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The painting takes place in a family home so there is a limit to how many we can accommodate, but if
                you have RSVPd to an invitation it should be fine.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What time does it start?</h2>
            <p>Generally things start happening at around 12 but you are welcome to turn up anytime from then on. If you have young 
                children it's probably best to come early in the afternoon, but if you want to paint undisturbed by young children 
                then maybe aim for later.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What will be expected of you?</h2>
            <p>Mostly, that you have a good time!</p>
            <p>Remember, you are guests in a private home so please behave in a courteous and respectful manner.</p>
            <p>
                If you bring young children you are responsible for their care. Though there are lots of helpful adults around,
                you are responsible for your children's safety and behaviour at all times - those other adults also want to paint! 
                We know that it's easy to get caught up in your creative endeavours to the exclusion of all else, but it's
                up to you to arrange for someone (your long suffering partner? take turns with a friend?) to arrange 
                for suitable supervision for your children.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a strong expectation that you will paint at least one egg. There are a small number of curmudgeonly 
                people (outrageous!) who don't, but be warned that you can expect to be on the receiving end of some
                social pressure to conform. You are allowed to resist (though we'd really rather you didn't!).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What will be provided?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Blown eggs that are ready to paint (usually chicken eggs, as white as we can manage), enough for each person to 
                    paint at least one, and usually two. Sometimes there are enough for you to do more but please check with a Hodgkin 
                    first - we don't want anyone to miss out.</li>
                <li>Paints, dyes, pencils, textas, crayons etc.</li>
                <li>
                    Brushes (basic quality - some people bring artist quality brushes but please do not use them without
                    asking their owner. If you're not sure which ones are OK to use, just ask. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Please don't leave brushes uncleaned - some paint can't be removed once it's dry.</li>
                        <li>Please don't leave good brushes soaking in jars of water - it ruins the ends and some are very expensive 
                            to replace!</li>
                        <li>Much as we encourage kids to paint, please don't give young kids good brushes without supervision.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h3>Lunch</h3>
                <li>
                    Some sort of light meal (almost certainly involving scrambled eggs and toast - gotta use up all those insides!). 
                    We try to cater to vegetarians and gluten-sensitive people. If you have special requirements let us know, but if 
                    they are complex or seriously life threatening it might be best to bring your own food. PLease remeber that you 
                    are responsible for what your children eat - if there are things you don't want them to have it's up to you to make 
                    sure that they don't.
                </li>
                <h3>Dinner</h3>
                <li>If you are amongst the die-hards that are still painting at dinnertime, you are welcome to join us for dinner. 
                    This is usually something fishy - please let us know if you think you'll be there so that we have enough.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Will alcohol be served?</h2>
            <p>
                Not during the day, though there may be wine if you are there for dinner. You may bring wine, beer or cider to consume 
                in moderation if you like, but moderation is the key word. Definitely no alcohol to be provided to or consumed by minors.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I smoke?</h2>
            <p>Only if you go outside, and far enough away that you won't bother anyone else. Generally this means out the back near 
                the laundry, not on the park side as that's where the children tend to play. If in doubt, ask a Hodgkin.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What can I bring?</h2>
            <p>
                You don't need to bring anything! We're happy to just have you come along, but if you want to
                contribute the following are always welcome:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    White eggs - Chicken, Ducks, Geese, Emus, Ostriches, whatever! If you have some spare they are always
                    welcome. Really white eggs are hard to find, so if you bring those you will be welcomed most enthusiastically!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chocolate Easter Eggs / Bunnies / Bilbies (or carob, marshmallow or icing) - absolutely not
                    required, but if you really want to...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other snacks (it's great to have some things that AREN'T chocolate!) / non alcoholic drinks
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I take my painted egg(s) home?</h2>
            <p>
                Of course! The family is prepared to store up to 2 eggs per person per year - that way you become part of the 
                accumulated history. If you do leave eggs behind they will be put on display very Easter, as part of the collection.
                This is usually just in the family home but we have had an Eggsibition at CMAG in the past, so they could go potentially 
                go on public display.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is it OK to take pictures?</h2>
            <p>
                As a general rule, yes, of the eggs themselves. However, please be aware that some people may prefer not to be included 
                in photos, so please respect their wishes.
            </p>
            <p>Please do not take pictures of other people's children with asking them first.</p>
            <p><strong>Please do not share pictures of anyone else to any form of social media without their permission.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <h2>Are there any other activities?</h2>
                <p>
                    There probably will be an easter egg hunt for the younger children. Your children will be welcome
                    to take part if we know that we're coming, but be aware that they will probably want to eat any eggs
                    they find. If they are allergic to chocolate or dairy or anything else in the eggs that we hide you
                    should probably bring something you can swap them for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There may be other children's activities, but then again, there may not. There is a lovely yard out the front and a 
                    park nearby that you can take your children to if the weather is good. Be prepared to entertain your children as 
                    necessary to allow other people to concentrate on their eggs.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Remember the day is about enjoying a social activity and unleashing your creativity. Be considerate of other
        people and have fun!
